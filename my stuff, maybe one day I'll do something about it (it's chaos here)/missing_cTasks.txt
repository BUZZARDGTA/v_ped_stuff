I found out theses are missing from: https://alloc8or.re/gta5/doc/enums/eTaskTypeIndex.txt
I'm looking at making my own updated list as this one is getting pretty old. (December 15th, 2020)
i simply still haven't figured out how/where they obtained their resolved values yet.

CTaskCuffed
CTaskInCustody
CTaskConversationHelper
CTaskNMDrunk
CTaskNM_RagdollDamping
CTaskNM_UpdateCharacterHealth
